# os
OS build for csc159 at CSUS

## Seperated into two parts
This reflects a change in professor midway through the semester

### First part
phase 0 -- phase designed to get students oriented with build environment  
phase1 -- implemented the basic OS structures and components (kernel / userpace, PCB, process queues, trapframe, clock syscall, etc.)  
phase2 -- implemented a basic lower half keyboard driver and allowed i/o operations via read/write syscalls  
phase3 -- implemented process creation via fork syscall  

### Second part
phase1 -- similar to phase 1 in first part  
phase2 -- implemented IPC via semaphores and message passing
